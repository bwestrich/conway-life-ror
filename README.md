# Ruby on Rails Implementation of Conways Game of Life

by [Brian Westrich](http://mcwest.com/).

Status of implemention: 
  functional but ugly
  
Future hopes: 
  
  convert use of global ruby variable for game board to session variable (until do this, only one user can 
    use web app at a time) 
    
  update game boards using JavaScript (so are more visually pleasing)
  
  add an "auto-evolve" (currently have to click a link for each evolultion)
  
  improve game performance by using AJAX
