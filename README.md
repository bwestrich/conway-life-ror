# Ruby on Rails Implementation of Conway's Game of Life

by [Brian Westrich](http://mcwest.com/).

Status of implemention: 
  logically correct, but only works in single-user mode and has ugly UI
  
Future hopes: 
  
  convert use of global ruby variable for game board to session variable (until do this, only one user can 
    use web app at a time) 
    
  update game boards using JavaScript (so are more visually pleasing)
  
  add an "auto-evolve" (currently have to click a link for each evolution)
  
  improve game performance by using AJAX
